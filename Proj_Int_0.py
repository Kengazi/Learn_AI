#   Hello my name is Kendall Johnson and I have created a basic leason place to learn Machine Learning (ML) for Data Science

#   First we will strengthen your python skills
#   Next basic ML statgies on a dataset
#   Followed by Artifical Neural Nets (ANN)
#   Then we will work with OpenCV
#   Lastly we will learn and implement YOLO Models and Tensor Models
#   Then you will make your own image classifier if there is time
#   I hope to also have add some linux commands and data analysis on sensor platforms

# Most of the scripts will be self explainitory but this youtube channel with help if you have any problems
# I would actually recommend watching many of them before you start your assignments they correspond very well

# I can be reached for absolutly any reason at Kendall.Johnson@parsons.com

# Modules needed :: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sci-kit learn, keras, tensorflow, pytorch, and opencv 3.# 

# dataset :: Boston Houses, Titanic guest, Medical data, MNIST Handwritten digits, Cifar, Diabetes and Sensor Data

# Items :: We will need a Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi 4 with the Pi Camera both will work the same in theory

# Week 1 - A base in using data science with python
# 1.1 :: Basic Math in python and importing numpy 
# 1.2 :: Definitions and Functions
# 1.3 :: Complex Math in python and plotting

# Week 2 - Using Datasets
# 2.1 :: Pandas DataFrames

# 3.3 :: Logistic Regression

# Week 4 - Machine Learning Part 1
# 4.1 :: One - Hot - Encoding
# 4.2 :: Decision Tree
# 4.3 :: Random Forest

# Week 5 - Machine Learning Part 2
# 5.1 :: SVM
# 5.2 :: Naive Bayes
# 5.3 :: K-means (Sci-kit)

# Week 6 - Strenthing Models
# 6.1 :: K - Fold
# 6.2 :: Dealing with Missing Data
# 6.3 :: Gradient Descent

# Week 7 - Artificial Neural Networks
# 7.1 :: ANN (Sci-kit)

# Week 8 - Convolutional Neural Networks
# 8.1 :: Confusion Matrix (Sci-kit)
# 8.2 :: CNN (Pytorch)
# 8.3 :: CNN (Keras)

# By this time you will need a camera of some-type I currently use Rasp Pi 4 and the Rasp Pi camera (successfully), a Jetson Nano will do
 
# Week 9 - Open Computer Vision
