Week 4 - A base in using data science with python

4.2 :: Using Scikit-learn (sklearn) for Machine Learning

The goal of this assignment is to get you comfortable with doing working with ML models like Descision Tree.

Descision Tree : Allows the most optimized grouping of catagories for analysis 

Scikit-learn is an amazing tool for machine learning that provides datasets and models in a few lines

This data is based on a made up statistics of variables that go into a student graduating college in 4 years
The varables are goes to class 90% of the time, studys 3 hours+ a day, Family visits often, has more then 3 close college friends,
GPA over a 2.0, and if that did graduate ontime

Your turn

In the Excel File named Grad2_data.xlsx

there is this data plus 2 extra catagories GForBF which is if the indivual had a girlfriend or boyfriend for most
of college, and if the student live on or of campus

Use this excel file to make preditions on the graduation status of these students

Paul = [0,1,0,0,0,1,1]

Beth = [1,1,0,0,0,0,1]

TJ = [0,0,0,1,0,1,1]

Rebecca = [1,1,1,1,0,1,0]

Ngazi = [1,1,0,1,0,1,1]

What is you opinion of this data
